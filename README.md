# Baseball-stats-project
A project-in-progress using RStudio and Sqlite to create a database.

The original four files:
  Main file: game_log. This file contains data on baseball games played from 1871 to 2016. Definitions: putouts: the number of times a defensive player got an offensive player out. def_pos: Stands for defensive position. Indicates which defense position the player takes. The position list follows: 
  1. Pitcher 
  2. Catcher 
  3. First base 
  4. Second base 
  5. Third base 
  6. Shortstop 
  7. Left field 
  8. Center field 
  9. Right field 

The playerâ€™s number does not necessarily correspond to their defensive position.

Helper files: 
  1. person_codes: contains the IDs, names, and start date for players, coaches, and umpires referenced in the game_log. Primary key is id. Various correlations in the game_log: _umpire_id, _manager_id, _player_id; _pitcher_name, _manager_name, _umpire_name. 
  2. park_codes: Contains name, location, league, and usage dates. Primary key is park_id, which corresponds to park_id in the game_log file. 
  3. team_codes: Lists the team information, such as league and location. Primary key is team_id, which is contained in game_log/v_name and game_log/h_name. Following is a guide to the league abbreviations.
  AA = American Association (1882-1891)
  AL = American League (est. 1901)
  FL = Federal League (1914-1915)
  NL = National League (est. 1876)
  PL = Player's League (1890)
  UA = Union Association (1884)
	4. appearance_type: Lists the various positions (offensive, defensive, manager, umpire, etc.) with their respective codes and categories. Primary key is appearance_type_id.

The new tables are as follows:
  1. person = contains the id, last name, and first name of individual named in each game.
  2. league = lists just the id and league name based on the league information above.
  3. appearance_type = describes the job each person had in the game, i.e. pitcher, manager, left field umpire.]
  4. team_info = contains all the team information.
  5. game = derived mainly from the game_log table, it contains the game-specific information.
  
The database name is bb.db.
